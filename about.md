Hello! I'm an undergraduate at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), studying for a 5-year dual degree in Medicine & Management from 2020/09 to expected 2025/06, double majoring in Preventive Medicine & Public Administration. My research interests include aging and neurodegenerative diseases. My recent work focuses on disease predictors based on DNA methylation, building Python library of biomarkers in aging, and single-cell gene expression analyses. Previously, I measured the excess deaths due to neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm also interested in deep learning and network theory.

I am honored to be advised by Prof. Jinjun Ran from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sph/index.htm), and fortunate to work as a research assistant in the [Gladyshev lab](https://gladyshevlab.bwh.harvard.edu/) from Harvard Medical School.
