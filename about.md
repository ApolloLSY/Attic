Hello! I’m Siyuan Li, an undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, double majoring in Public Health and Administrative Management. My research interests include aging and neurodegenerative diseases. My recent work focuses on disease predictors based on DNA methylation, building Python library of biomarkers in aging, and single-cell interpretation. Additionally, I measured the excess deaths due to neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m also interested in machine learning and digital twin modeling.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jinjun Ran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VjVQi2IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from [School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sph/index.htm), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I was honored to work as a research assistant (RA) in the [Gladyshev lab](https://gladyshevlab.bwh.harvard.edu/) from [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/).
