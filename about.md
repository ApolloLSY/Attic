Hello! I’m an undergraduate at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), double majoring in Public Health and Public Administration. I am studying for a 5-year dual degree in Medicine & Management from 2020/09 to expected 2025/06. My research interests include aging and neurodegenerative diseases. My recent work focuses on disease predictors based on DNA methylation, building Python library of biomarkers in aging, and single-cell interpretation. Previously, I measured the excess deaths due to neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m also interested in deep learning and network theory.

I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Jinjun Ran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VjVQi2IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sph/index.htm), And I was fortunate to work as a research assistant (RA) in the [Gladyshev lab](https://gladyshevlab.bwh.harvard.edu/) from [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/).
